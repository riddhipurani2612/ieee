                  SweepSAR, referred as NISAR scheduled to be launched in 2022.
                  The NISAR mission is expected to provide dual frequency
                  space-borne SAR data with high resolution, larger swath and
                  high repeat cycle, with full-polarimetric capability and
                  Interferometric modes of operation for numerous science
                  studies and host of applications. This talk will focus on the
                  unique features of the dual frequency NISAR as well as the
                  various science studies and applications planned with this
                  mission.

                  As a part of Distinguished Lecture Program , IEEE-GRSS
                  (Gujarat chapter) organized a webinar session on the
                  topic“GeoAI: Applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning to
                  Geospatial Data" on 31st July, 2020 (5:00 pm to 6:30 pm -IST).
                  The webinar was delivered by Mr. Rohit Singh, who is the
                  managing director of Esri's AI R&D Center at New Delhi. Rohit
                  Singh leads the development of data science, deep learning and
                  geospatial AI solutions in the ArcGIS platform. Rohit is
                  passionate about deep learning and its intersection with
                  geospatial data and satellite imagery. He is a graduate of the
                  Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, and has worked at
                  computer vision startups and IBM before joining Esri. He
                  conceptualized, designed and developed ArcGISPython API,
                  ArcObjects Java, ArcGIS Engine Java API and ArcGIS Enterprise
                  (Linux). In his extremely engaging talk, he introduced the key
                  concepts and the thin line of differences/inter-relationship
                  between Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence and Deep
                  learning. This was followed by an indepth understanding of its
                  application in the Geospatial domain, especially handling of
                  computationally big and volumnious spatial datasets,
                  sturctured and unstructured data, etc. Along with the
                  theorectical concepts and case studies, an extremely
                  interactive demonstration of various AI & ML algorithms in the
                  ArcGIS environment was demostrated on the fly using jupyter
                  notebooks, for thematic applications like identification of
                  buliding footprints, damaged and undamaged ships,
                  identification of road cracks & its types , and many such
                  more. The session was highly enriching and practical oriented,
                  thus allowing students and researchers to gain more techincal
                  insights on this fast growing domain. ​ With 300+

                  The distinguished lecture program of GRSS was organized on
                  11th September at 4:45 pm using virtual platform. The
                  distinguished lecture was delivered by Dr David G Long. He is
                  faculty of the Electrical and Computer Engineering department
                  (www.ee.byu.edu) at Brigham Young University (www.byu.edu).
                  Before this, he was employed at NASA's Jet Propulsion
                  Laboratory (JPL) in the Radar Science and Engineering Section.
                  He was responsible for the design and development of the NASA
                  Scatterometer (NSCAT) system to measure ocean surface winds
                  from space. NSCAT successfully flew aboard Japanese ADEOS
                  spacecraft in 1996. He was a Group Leader in the Radar Systems
                  Engineering Group at JPL were he supervised work on the design
                  and analysis of spaceborne scatterometer and SAR systems
                  including NSCAT, SIR-C, and Magellan. He was the original
                  Experiment Manager for SCANSCAT (now known as SeaWinds, it was
                  first launched in 1999 on QuikSCAT, again in 2003 on ADEOS-II,
                  and again as RapidScat on the International Space Station in
                  2014). He has received several NASA Award of Achievement and
                  Team Recognition Awards. His research interests include
                  microwave remote sensing, spaceborne scatterometry, synthetic
                  aperture radar, signal processing, polar ice, and mesoscale
                  atmospheric dynamics. He is an associate editor for IEEE
                  Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters. He is a co-author of
                  the textbook, F. Ulaby and D.G. Long, Microwave Radar and
                  Radiometric Remote Sensing, ISBN: 978-0-472-11935-6,
                  University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 2013,
                  available through Artech House and Amazon. ​ ​The topic of
                  lecture was Satellite Scatterometry: Winds, Vegetation, and
                  Ice. With brief introduction about the faculty, Dr David Long
                  presented his research work on Satellite scatterometry with
                  applications related to winds, vegetation and ice. Satellite
                  scatterometers have been built and flown by several nations
                  including, the U.S., ESA, India, and China. Due to coarse
                  resolution of scatterometer, it becomes difficult to evolve
                  land based applications. Reprocessing of data for enhanced
                  resolution foot print of few km helps us to use the instrument
                  for land applications. These enhanced resolution products
                  makes it as a powerful instrument for high resolution
                  wind/rain estimation as well as in a variety of studies of
                  polar ice and tropical vegetation. Dr David Long brought out
                  many applications related to winds, vegetation and Antarctic
                  iceberg monitoring. There were about 70 participants
                  representing different countries.

                  Expert talk by Prof. Mahta Moghaddam (University of Southern
                  California) has been arranged on the topic "Microwave Sensing
                  Through the Subsurface for Addressing the Water Puzzle". ​
                  With increasing population and changes in the global climate,
                  water-related issues have been identified by the Intelligence
                  Community as an important factor in the US world-wide threat
                  assessment. Much of the environmental remote sensing work
                  discussed in this talk has been motivated and designed based
                  on the above recognition. This talk starts by a brief
                  description of some of the critical problems in the remote
                  sensing of water resources today, and discusses how our
                  research addresses several components of these problems by
                  developing new low-frequency (e.g., P-band) spaceborne and
                  airborne radar sensor technologies, electromagnetic scattering
                  and inverse scattering models, and in-situ sensor networks.
                  The emerging research on subsurface characterization is
                  discussed, which aims to map the profiles of soil water
                  content from surface to the root zone, variations in
                  permafrost properties, and groundwater. ​ About Speaker: Mahta
