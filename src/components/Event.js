              The distinguished lecture program of GRSS was organized on 11th
              September at 4:45 pm using virtual platform. The distinguished
              lecture was delivered by Dr David G Long. He is faculty of the
              Electrical and Computer Engineering department (www.ee.byu.edu) at
              Brigham Young University (www.byu.edu). Before this, he was
              employed at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in the Radar
              Science and Engineering Section. He was responsible for the design
              and development of the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) system to
              measure ocean surface winds from space. NSCAT successfully flew
              aboard Japanese ADEOS spacecraft in 1996. He was a Group Leader in
              the Radar Systems Engineering Group at JPL were he supervised work
              on the design and analysis of spaceborne scatterometer and SAR
              systems including NSCAT, SIR-C, and Magellan. He was the original
              Experiment Manager for SCANSCAT (now known as SeaWinds, it was
              first launched in 1999 on QuikSCAT, again in 2003 on ADEOS-II, and
              again as RapidScat on the International Space Station in 2014). He
              has received several NASA Award of Achievement and Team
              Recognition Awards. His research interests include microwave
              remote sensing, spaceborne scatterometry, synthetic aperture
              radar, signal processing, polar ice, and mesoscale atmospheric
              dynamics. He is an associate editor for IEEE Geoscience and Remote
              Sensing Letters. He is a co-author of the textbook, F. Ulaby and
              D.G. Long, Microwave Radar and Radiometric Remote Sensing, ISBN:
              978-0-472-11935-6, University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor,
              Michigan, 2013, available through Artech House and Amazon. ​The
              topic of lecture was Satellite Scatterometry: Winds, Vegetation,
              and Ice. With brief introduction about the faculty, Dr David Long
              presented his research work on Satellite scatterometry with
              applications related to winds, vegetation and ice. Satellite
              scatterometers have been built and flown by several nations
              including, the U.S., ESA, India, and China. Due to coarse
              resolution of scatterometer, it becomes difficult to evolve land
              based applications. Reprocessing of data for enhanced resolution
              foot print of few km helps us to use the instrument for land
              applications. These enhanced resolution products makes it as a
              powerful instrument for high resolution wind/rain estimation as
              well as in a variety of studies of polar ice and tropical
              vegetation. Dr David Long brought out many applications related to
              winds, vegetation and Antarctic iceberg monitoring. There were
              about 70 participants representing different countries.

              platform. Rohit is passionate about deep learning and its
              intersection with geospatial data and satellite imagery. He is a
              graduate of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, and has
              worked at computer vision startups and IBM before joining Esri. He
              conceptualized, designed and developed ArcGISPython API,
              ArcObjects Java, ArcGIS Engine Java API and ArcGIS Enterprise
              (Linux).
