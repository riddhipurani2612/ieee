            The GRS society is one of 38 societies that belong to the world’s
            largest professional society, and that is the IEEE. The vision of
            the GRS society is to be the leading society in the science,
            engineering, application and education of remote sensing.

            You can have online access to our three premier journals: the IEEE
            Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS), IEEE Journal
            of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing
            (J-STARS) and the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters (GRSL).
            Our Society’s archival publications represent the forefront of
            remote sensing science, technology and applications. The
            Transactions are among the premier journals in IEEE as well as
            remote sensing journals in terms of citation index and impact
            factor. Members can access the latest issues either on-line or via
            hard copies in the mail.

            You can participate in our five Technical Committees: Earth Science
            Informatics (ESI), Image Analysis and Data Fusion (IADF), Frequency
            Allocations in Remote Sensing (FARS), Instrumentation and Future
            Technologies (IFT), and International Spaceborne Imaging
            Spectroscopy (ISIS). The technical committees work together to
            review the state of art of technology in these research areas. The
            Technical Committees make important impacts on the future directions
            of remote sensing technologies. As a GRSS member, you can take a
            leadership role in this process.

            You can attend IGARSS, our premier conference, at a reduced rate and
            also participate in the planning of IGARSS. You can utilize the
            resources provided by the Society, such as our quarterly Magazine,
            education programs, industrial relations and newsletter, on-line
            lectures and current state-of-the-art information of the IEEE GRSS
            (www.grss-ieee.org). The Society puts forth a lot of effort in
            remote sensing education initiatives, development and collection of
            educational resources for K-12, college/ graduate education as well
            as continuing education for professionals. Members can access these
            resources. We are strengthening our industry relations program. As a
            member, you can connect to our industrial partners via this
            initiative.Other benefits of IEEE GRSS members include subscription
            to IEEE Spectrum magazine, access to IEEE Xplore data base, IEEE
            e-mail alias, network with others in the local member community
            (chapters), career and employment resources, etc.
